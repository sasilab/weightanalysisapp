Sure! Based on your recent project idea — an **AI system that analyzes research papers on robotic grippers**, extracts specified parameters, and ranks the grippers based on adjustable weightages — here's a professional and clear `README.md` template you can customize:

# 🤖 AI-Powered Robotic Gripper Ranking System

An AI-assisted platform that allows researchers and engineers to upload academic papers (PDFs) on robotic grippers, extract important parameters (e.g., actuation mechanism, payload, cost), assign custom weights to those parameters, and rank the grippers accordingly. The system helps compare and evaluate grippers based on performance, safety, cost, and custom-defined priorities.

## 📌 Features

* 🧠 **AI Extraction**: Automatically extracts structured parameters from unstructured research PDFs using LLMs (OpenAI).
* 📊 **Custom Ranking**: Adjust weights for different parameters and compare grippers based on your application needs.
* 🗂️ **Parameter Memory**: Remembers extracted parameters, missing values, and updates with new PDFs.
* 📈 **Visualization**: View gripper comparison results as interactive tables and graphs.
* 🧪 **Interactive Interface**: Built with Gradio for user-friendly uploads and adjustments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology            |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Interface     | Gradio                |
| Backend       | FastAPI               |
| AI Model      | OpenAI GPT (via API)  |
| Storage       | SQLite                |
| Visualization | Plotly / Matplotlib   |
| File Handling | PyMuPDF, pdfminer.six |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**: Upload one or more research papers.
2. **Parameter Extraction**: The system extracts predefined parameters like:

   * Actuation Mechanism
   * Payload Capacity
   * Dexterity
   * Safety Mechanisms
   * Control Algorithm
   * Cost & Material
3. **Assign Weights**: Define what matters most for your use case by adjusting weights (e.g., prioritize payload over cost).
4. **Ranking & Visualization**: View rankings in real-time with bar charts, radar plots, or sortable tables.

## 🧩 Use Cases

* Comparative analysis for research in soft robotics
* Assisting in gripper design selection
* Fast review of gripper literature by parameter
* Grant/project proposal support

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gripper-ranking-ai.git
cd gripper-ranking-ai
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

In a separate terminal:

```bash
poetry run python app.py  # launches Gradio UI
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* Add your OpenAI API key to `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

* You can customize parameters and weights in the UI or via `config/params.yaml`.
